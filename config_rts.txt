# config file for jupyter descriptive statistics

# enter information about the conditions below
# every condition needs to be on a new line
# the format is the following:
# <condName>; <columnName>: <columnValue(s)>
#
# <condName>: a condition name chosen by you (please only use letters and underscores)
# <columnName>: this needs to match the column name in the PsychoPy csv output files
# <columnValue(s)>: this needs to match one or more values in the corresponding column
#
# lines beginning with # are comments and will be ignored
# 
# e.g., get RTs for switch and repeat trials:
# switchAll; trlType: switch
# repeatAll; trlType: repeat
#
# if a condition is defined by multiple columns, add more columns:
#  <condName>; <columnName>: <columnValue(s)>; <columnName>: <columnValue(s)>
# e.g., get RTs for *correct* (assuming 1 means correct) switch and repeat trials
# switch; trlType: switch; response.corr: 1
# repeat; trlType: repeat; response.corr: 1
#
# please note that the column names need to match the column names in the PsychoPy output file*
# e.g., if your accuracy column were called response.corr, you need to write:
# switch; trlType: switch; response.corr: 1
# e.g., correct switch trials from the short CTI:
# switchShort; trlType: switch; cti: short; response.corr: 1
#
# *there is one exception to this rule: column names must not include hyphens;
# if your column names do include hyphens, replace them by underscores when you define your conditions below
# (you do not need to replace them in the PsychoPy output files)
#
#
# separators are relevant
# - use semicolons to separate condition names and relevant columns
# - use colons to separate column names from column values
# - use commas to separate multiple values
#   - e.g.: switch; trlType: switch; response.corr: 1,2
#
# 
# note that the default comparison operator is "equal"
# i.e., "accuracy: 2" means a trial will be included if the accuracy equals 2
# however, you can define other comparison operators; these are:
# >, <, >=, <=, !=
# these alternative comparison operators require the following syntax:
# <columnName>: [operator]<columnValue>
# e.g.: "response.rt: [>]0.4" would only include RTs longer than 0.4 s


# all correct trials after correct trials
#rt_postCorrect_rsi1; trlType: orig; accuracy: 2; realRsi: a
#rt_postCorrect_rsi2; trlType: orig; accuracy: 2; realRsi: b
#rt_postCorrect_rsi3; trlType: orig; accuracy: 2; realRsi: c
#rt_postCorrect_rsi4; trlType: orig; accuracy: 2; realRsi: d

# all correct trials after error trials
#rt_postError_rsi1; trlType: posterror_incon,posterror_con; accuracy: 2; realRsi: a
#rt_postError_rsi2; trlType: posterror_incon,posterror_con; accuracy: 2; realRsi: b
#rt_postError_rsi3; trlType: posterror_incon,posterror_con; accuracy: 2; realRsi: c
#rt_postError_rsi4; trlType: posterror_incon,posterror_con; accuracy: 2; realRsi: d
