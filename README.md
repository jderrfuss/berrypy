# BerryPy

## What does BerryPy stand for?

**B**asic **er**ror and **r**esponse time anal**y**ses in **Py**thon

## What is BerryPy?

A Jupyter notebook for computing individual RTs and error rates, and collating these data across participants.

## What is needed to run BerryPy?

* Jupyter Notebook (Python 2.7)
* shutil
* numpy
* pandas
* glob
* os
* errno
* re
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sys

## What can BerryPy do?

- Reject extreme values (below/above a given RT threshold)
- Reject outlier RTs (based on SDs, trimming, or median absolute deviations)
- Define conditions based on information in the input file
- Compute mean or median RTs
- Compute accuracies/error rates
  - Note: BerryPy rejects extreme values *before* calculating accuracies

BerryPy reads input files produced by an experiment control programme (e.g., [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/)), and produces a .csv output file that can be imported into SPSS or other statistical software packages.

BerryPy looks for its input files in the folder `input` (located in the same folder as the notebook itself), and writes its output to the folder `output`.

## Aims and objectives

Aims | Objectives
-----|-----------
Easy to use | Typical user interaction via text configuration files
Flexible | Defining conditions quite powerful out of the box
Extensible | Open source â€“ modify code, add code

Additional aims from a teaching perspective | Objectives
--------------------------------------------|-----------
Think about preprocessing steps | Need to define parameters in config files
No unnecessary user interaction | Automatically processes all .csv files in input directory
Visualise individual data | Creates Markdown output file with RT distributions and plausibility checks

## Limitations

BerryPy works best with standard [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/) output files. For example:

- BerryPy expects the input files to have a header
- BerryPy expects one trial per line

All of this can of course be adapted, but this will require some Python knowledge.

## How does BerryPy work?

Please note that the description below assumes that you know how to open a Jupyter notebook.

1. Download and unzip BerryPy. Change your working directory to the newly created BerryPy folder.
1. Add raw data to the folder `input` (by default, BerryPy expects .csv files, but this can be changed in the notebook)
1. Edit configuration files (see below for details)
1. Open the notebook
1. Use `Cell` &rarr; `Run All` to run the notebook
1. Results are written to the folder `output` (details below)

Please note that there will be no centrally installed BerryPy package. If you have folders for your various projects, it probably makes most sense to make BerryPy a subfolder of a given project.

## The configuration files

Note that the configuration files address the most common options. If the analysis needs to go beyond these options, extra functions can be added to the notebook (the notebook contains an example function that has been commented out to illustrate this).

### General settings

- File name: `config_general_settings.txt`
- Contains info about relevant column names in input files (e.g. `response.corr` for accuracy of response)
- Set thresholds for extreme values (e.g., exclude anything below 100 ms and above 2000 ms)
- Define measure of central tendency (i.e., mean or median)
- Outlier rejection using SD, trimmed mean, or median absolute deviation

### RT analysis

- File name: `config_rts.txt`
- Name and define conditions for output file
- Basic syntax:
    - `<columnName>: [operator]<columnValue>`, where `<columnName>` is the column name in the input file (e.g., `response.corr`) and `<columnValue>` is the value (e.g., `0` for incorrect)
- Operators
    - equal (default): `=`
    - does not equal: `!=`
    - below: `<`
    - below or equal: `<=`
    - above: `>`
    - above or equal: `>=`

### Error analysis

- File name: `config_errors.txt`
- Same syntax rules and operators as for RTs
- Major difference to RT configuration file: need to define ratio using `/`
  - Basic syntax: `<trialsOfInterest>/<allTrials>`

## Examples

Minimal input file example:

condition | response.corr | response.rt | trials.thisN | stimVisibility | stimLocation
----------|--------------:|------------:|-------------:|:--------------:|:-----------:
congruent | 1 | 0.624 | 0 | high | left
incongruent | 0 | 0.683 | 1 | low | left
incongruent | 1 | 0.727 | 2 | high | right
congruent | 1 | 0.386 | 3 | low | centre
incongruent | 1 | 0.495 | 4 | low | centre
incongruent | 1 | 0.528 | 5 | high | right
incongruent | 0 | 0.581 | 6 | high | centre
congruent | 0 | 0.669 | 7 | low | right
congruent | 1 | 0.421 | 8 | high | left
... |||||
incongruent | 1 | 0.484 | 99 | low | centre

### RT analysis

Please note that the measure of central tendency and the name of the RT column need to be specified in the general settings file.

**Example content of RT configuration file**

```
# compute mean congruent and incongruent RTs for correct trials only
# conRT and inconRT will be the column headers in the output file
# not necessary to add default operator equal
conRT; condition: congruent; response.corr: 1
inconRT; condition: incongruent; response.corr: 1

# as above, but exclude the first 20 trials (i.e., trial numbers 0 to 19)
conRT; condition: congruent; response.corr: 1; trials.thisN: [>=]20
inconRT; condition: incongruent; response.corr: 1; trials.thisN: [>=]20

# mean con RTs separately for low and high visibility trials
conRT_lowVis; condition: congruent; response.corr: 1; stimVisibility: low
conRT_highVis; condition: congruent; response.corr: 1; stimVisibility: high

# mean con RTS for lateralised stimuli
conRT_lateral; condition: congruent; response.corr: 1; stimLocation: left,right

# alternatively
conRT_lateral; condition: congruent; response.corr: 1; stimLocation: [!=]centre
```

### Error analysis

**Example content of error configuration file**

```
# accuracies for congruent and incongruent trials
conAcc; condition: congruent; response.corr: 1/0,1
inconAcc; condition: incongruent; response.corr: 1/0,1

# alternatively, using error rates
conErr; condition: congruent; response.corr: 0/0,1
inconAcc; condition: incongruent; response.corr: 0/0,1

# accuracies for high-vis trials only
conAcc_highVis; condition: congruent; response.corr: 1/0,1; stimVisibility: high
inconAcc_highVis; condition: incongruent; response.corr: 1/0,1; stimVisibility: high
```

## The output

* In the folder `output`, there will be a file called `output.csv`: This file contains the means or medians (dependent on what you chose in the general settings file) and error rates (if you asked for them) for every participant and condition
* In the same folder, there will be a Markdown file called `report.md`
  * It provides basic sanity checks for every participant (e.g., overall percentage of timeouts and errors)
  * It provides information about the distribution of RTs
  * It tells you how many trials were rejected as outliers
* You can view the Markdown output file using a dedicated Markdown viewer, or a Markdown extension for your browser

## Bugs and improvements

I can't guarantee that BerryPy contains no bugs. If you find one, please let me/GitHub know. The same goes for suggestions for improvement.
