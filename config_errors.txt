# define conditions for which to calculate error rates
# you need to specify (a) which values constitute errors and (b) which values constitute all trials
#
# enter information about the conditions below
# every condition needs to be on a new line
# the format is the following:
# <condName>; <columnName>: <columnValue(s)>
#
# <condName>: a condition name chosen by you (please only use letters and underscores)
# <columnName>: this needs to match the column name in the PsychoPy csv output files
# <columnValue(s)>: this needs to match one or more values in the corresponding column
#
# lines beginning with # are comments and will be ignored
#
# let's assume we have two types of values in the accuracy column
# 0 = incorrect response
# 1 = correct response
# To calculate the percentage of incorrect responses, you would write:
# (...); response.corr: 0/0,1; (...)
# Note the forward slash! This is crucial and needs to be there!
#
# let's assume we have three types of values in the accuracy column
# 0 = timeout (no response)
# 1 = incorrect response
# 2 = correct response
# To calculate the percentage of incorrect responses, you would write:
# (...); response.corr: 1/0,1,2; (...)
# To calculate the total error rate (timeouts + incorrect responses), you would write:
# (...); response.corr: 0,1/0,1,2; (...)
#
# By default, PsychoPy distinguishes only error and correct trials:
# 0 = error
# 1 = correct
#
# By default, the PsychoPy name for the column with accuracy information is response.corr
